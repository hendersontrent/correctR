Description: Calculate a set of corrected test statistics for cases when samples
    are not independent, such as when classification accuracy values are obtained
    over resamples or through k-fold cross-validation, as proposed by Nadeau and Bengio (2003) <doi:10.1023/A:1024068626366> 
    and presented in Bouckaert and Frank (2004) <doi:10.1007/978-3-540-24775-3_3>.
